# Flower-Classification
Classifying flower on the basis of certain features such as sepal width/length ,petal width/length.

Do you ever feel "How can we classify different flowers just by having some features of it like sepal length/width or petal length/width",
if so then this project is for u.
Here,The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. 
Based on this features I am going to classify these 3 different type of flowers using some "Machine Learning" algorithms.

First, I am going to do some data exploration and visualization using "Matplotlib" and "Seaborn" module of python to show you some graphs.

Now, just dig into the code of "SVM Classification" and try to understand the difference among this graphs that are just clustering same type of flowers together. You will notice that one of them is clustering in a better way(try to notice scores also).

Finally notice the difference between SVM and K Nearest Neighbour by seeing this one.
(Last Classification is done by kNN)

So that's my analysis, if you want to introduce some changes by yourself,you can do and can commit the changes to make this classification of flowers more accurate.

### Thanku...Have a nice day!!
