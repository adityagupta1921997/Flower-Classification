# Flower-Classification
Classifying flower on the basis of certain features such as sepal width/length ,petal width/length.

Do you ever feel "How can we classify different flowers just by having some features of it like sepal length/width or petal length/width",
if so then this project is for u.
Here,The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. 
Based on this features I am going to classify these 3 different type of flowers using some "Machine Learning" algorithms.
